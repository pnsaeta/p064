A linear first-order differential equation has the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DE1}
  \dv{y}{t} + p(t) y(t) = q(t)
\end{equation}
where $$t$$ is the independent variable, $$y(t)$$ is the dependent variable, and $$q(t)$$ is a forcing function. If $$q(t) = 0$$, the equation is **homogeneous**; if not, it is **nonhomogeneous**.
