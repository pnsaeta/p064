# Contour Integration

We saw in [the page on Complex Variables](FO-ComplexVariables.md) that the integral around a closed contour on the complex plane may be evaluated by summing the residues of the enclosed poles. Let’s check this out by evaluating the following integral:
\begin{equation}
  I = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{1 + x^2}\dd{x}
\end{equation}
