## Problem 1

The goal of this problem if for you to solve the linear algebraic equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:axb}
  \mat{A} \cdot \vb{x} = \vb{b}
\end{equation}
where $$\mat{A}$$ is a tridiagonal matrix, $$\vb{x}$$ is the vector of unknown values, and $$\vb{b}$$ is a vector of known values. That is, you are trying to find the column vector $$\vb{x}$$ that solves an equation of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:axb2}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{00} & a_{01} & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\\ 
  a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} & 0 & \cdots \\\ 
  0 &      a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & \cdots \\\ 
  0 &      0      & a_{32} & a_{33} & \cdots \\\ 
  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  x_0 \\\ x_1 \\\ x_2 \\\ x_3 \\\ \vdots
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
  b_0 \\\ b_1 \\\ b_2 \\\ b_3 \\\ \vdots
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where the only nonzero values in $$\mat{A}$$ lie along the main diagonal and one diagonal off it on either side.

There is a very efficient approach to solving this kind of problem, known as the [Thomas algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridiagonal_matrix_algorithm) after Llewellyn Thomas, that you can read about on the linked Wikipedia page. Later in the course, we will use your routine as a means of solving the one-dimensional heat diffusion equation.
