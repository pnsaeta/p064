# Hilbert Space

[Back to the top](LinearAlgebra.md)

A **Hilbert space** is a vector space with an inner product that is used to define a distance function for which it is a complete metric space. That is, the “length” of a vector in the space is given by $$\parallel\vb{v}\parallel = \sqrt{(\vb{v},\vb{v})}$$. [See here](LinearAlgebra.md#complex-spaces) for the definition of inner product for vector spaces over the field of complex numbers.


Thus far we have considered vector and matrices of finite rank $$N$$. Does anything change if we let $$N \to \infty$$?
