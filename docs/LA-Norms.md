# The Norm of a Vector Space

* toc
{:toc}

I previously claimed that the **norm** of a vector in a space with a defined inner product is
\begin{equation}
  ||\vb{a}|| = \sqrt{\langle \vb{a}, \vb{a} \rangle}
\end{equation}
and this is indeed a satisfactory form. However, other definitions are possible, consistent with the following properties:

1. $$||\vb{v}|| \ge 0$$ ; $$||\vb{v}|| = 0$$
   if and only if $$\vb{v} = \vb{0}$$.
2. $$||\alpha \vb{v}|| = 
   |\alpha| ||\vb{v}||$$.
