## Problem

Are the following three vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ linearly independent?
$$
    (1, 2, 3) \qquad (-3, -2, -1) \qquad (2, 3, 4)
$$

## Problem — Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization

Given the three vectors
$$
    (1, 2, 3) \qquad (-3, -2, -1) \qquad (2, 3, 2)
$$
form an orthonormal set of basis vectors in which $$\vb{e}_1$$ is parallel to $$(1, 2, 3)$$.
