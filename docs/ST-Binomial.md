# Binomial Distribution

The binomial distribution describes the outcomes of an experiment with only two possible outcomes, but which is repeated many times. For example, if the probability that I can make a free throw is $$p$$, and if I shoot $$N$$ free throws, what is the probability that I make $$n$$ of them (where $$0 \le n \le N$$)? 

We'll call $$p$$ the probability of success and $$q = 1-p$$ the probability of failure. If we make two attempts, then the four possible outcomes are the terms in
\\[
    1 = (p+q) (p+q) = p^2 + 2 pq + q^2
\\]
where the first term shows the probability of 2 successes, the second the probability of a single success, and third the probability of no successes. Generalizing to $$N$$ attempts, we have the probability of $$n$$ successes is
\\[
    P(n) = \binom{N}{n} p^n q^{(N-n)} = \frac{N!}{n! (N-n)!} p^n q^{(N-n)}
\\] 
The average number of successes is then
\\[
    \ev{n} = \sum_{n=0}^{N} n P(n) = \sum_{n=0}^N n \binom{N}{n} p^n q^{N-n}
\\]
We can now employ our old friend, the **derivative trick**, to simplify this sum:
\\[
    \ev{n} = \sum_{n=0}^N \binom{N}{n} \left(p \pdv{}{p}\right) p^n q^{N-n}
    = \left(p \pdv{}{p}\right) \sum_{n=0}^N \binom{N}{n}  p^n q^{N-n} = \left(p\pdv{}{p}\right) (p+q)^N = p N (p+q)^{N-1} = Np
\\]
This was perhaps obvious from the start: each of the attempts is independent and has probability $$p$$ of success, so we should expect on average $$Np$$ successes. However, it points the way to computing the variance, which is average squared difference from the mean:
\\[
    \sigma^2 = \ev{(n-\ev{n})^2} = \ev{n^2 - 2n\ev{n} + \ev{n}^2} = \ev{n^2} - \ev{n}^2
\\]
Using the derivative trick again, we have
\\[
    \ev{n^2} = \qty(p\pdv{}{p}) \qty(p\pdv{}{p}) (p+q)^N = \qty(p\pdv{}{p}) N p(p+q)^{N-1} = p\qty[ N (p+q)^{N-1} + N p (N-1) (p+q)^{N-2}] = p[N + Np(N-1)]
\\]
so that the variance is
\\[
    \sigma^2 = \ev{n^2} - \ev{n}^2 = pN + p^2 (N^2 - N) - p^2 N^2 = N p (1 - p) = N p q
\\]
and the standard deviation is
\\[
    \sigma = \sqrt{N p q}
\\]
