# Syllabus

The first three semesters at Harvey Mudd College provide an introduction to computation in Python and grounding in important topics in the mathematics that underpins physics, including single- and multi-variable calculus, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations. This course builds on that foundation to develop your ability to use computation to explore physically meaningful problems and to extend your mathematical foundation to include several topics of central importance to physics, including

- Fourier series and transforms
- stochastic processes
- nonlinear dynamics and chaos
- systems of ordinary differential equations, and
- partial differential equations

Math/Physics Joint Majors must take Math 180 (*Introduction to Partial Differential Equations*); for straight physics majors, this course replaces Math 115 (*Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems*), which was a mainstay of the major for decades. Our purpose in developing it has been to integrate more carefully the mathematical and computational approaches to problem solving that physicists need to know for upper-division physics courses and research, and to help ensure that all majors achieve a fluency in computation that prepares them for further work in physics and related disciplines.

## Objectives

You will

- understand the centrality of linear algebra in physics and some of the numerical methods commonly used to solve linear algebraic problems

## Use of Artificial Intelligence

ChatGPT can write simple programs in a variety of languages, including Python. I might be tempted to use it to show me how to translate something I have already written in Python to a different language, such as Julia, which I haven't yet learned. However, our goals in this course include helping you develop your ability to solve problems using computation, to debug code, and to assess the reliability of solutions. The only way to learn how to solve complicated problems is to develop your skills on simpler ones—ones that are simple enough that modern A.I. tools can handle them. I ask you not to use them, however, because they will not help you develop a working foundation that you can extend to more complex and interesting problems.

## Mission

Harvey Mudd College seeks to educate engineers, scientists, and mathematicians well versed in all of these areas and in the humanities and social sciences so that they may assume leadership in their fields with a clear understanding of the impact of their work on society. 

*These days, well-versedness requires computational fluency.*

## Values

The Harvey Mudd College Physics Department recognizes the value, dignity, and
humanity of every member of our community. We strive to conduct ourselves with
honesty and integrity. We commit to building an environment that is welcoming,
supportive, and free from intimidation, harassment, and discrimination. And we
challenge ourselves to pursue educational and scientific excellence that
embodies these values. 

## Inclusion

HMC is committed to providing an inclusive learning environment and support for all students. Students with a disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions) who may need accommodations in order to fully participate in this class are encouraged to contact the Office of Accessible Education at access@g.hmc.edu to request accommodations. Students from the other Claremont Colleges should contact their home college's Accessible Education officer.

## Belonging

Everyone who is registered for this course belongs here and has valuable contributions to make to our class. Our diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints enrich the classroom, and our mutual respectn grants us all the grace to make mistakes and to learn from them. Some of my most memorable experiences in college center on just such mistakes.

Physics is a very challenging discipline—Nature, while not capricious, does not always read like an open book. Every successful physicist has failed countless times and has wondered whether she or he is cut out for this most beautiful and difficult discipline. What sustains any of us is the incredible realization that we *can* understand (some) things about how the physical universe actually works and that our understanding can be tested in a court of law that is not subject to the whims of mere mortals. In troubling times, this knowledge can be incredibly reassuring and definitely worth a few bruises along the way. When things are tough, reach out, get help; we're in this together!

I am dedicated to fostering an equitable atmosphere in this course, this department, and at HMC, while simultaneously maintaining standards that encourage and promote excellence. Please let me know if you have suggestions or concerns regarding the course or a specific situation; alternatively, you can bring concerns to another member of the faculty or staff.
